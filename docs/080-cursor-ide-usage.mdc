# 080 – Cursor IDE Usage

This document tells Cursor.ai how to optimally use this project structure and docs when implementing CLD-Engine and integrating it with BaklavaJS.

## 1. Reading Order for Implementation

When starting or resuming CLD-Engine work, Cursor should:

1. Read `docs/000-index.mdc` to confirm the document map.
2. Read `docs/010-goals-and-scope.mdc` to refresh constraints and objectives.
3. Read `docs/020-architecture-overview.mdc` to recall the core architecture and API design.
4. Read `docs/040-implementation-phases.mdc` to determine the next incomplete phase and detailed tasks.
5. For initial scaffolding or when touching tooling, read `docs/050-project-setup.mdc`.

The adapter integration with Baklava should be deferred until core phases are complete; at that time, read the integration doc in the Baklava workspace (to be created separately).

## 2. Preferred Tooling Behavior in Cursor

Cursor should:

- Use `apply_patch` to modify files under `CLD-Engine/`.
- Avoid editing `packages/core` or `packages/engine` in the Baklava repo when working on CLD-Engine.
- When it needs Baklava reference behavior:
  - Use `read_file` and `grep` on the Baklava workspace.
  - Do not copy code verbatim; instead, adapt concepts to the CLD-Engine data model.

## 3. Implementation Loop (Per Phase)

For each phase described in `040-implementation-phases.mdc`, Cursor should:

1. Identify current phase’s tasks and acceptance criteria.
2. Implement or update the relevant files under `src/`.
3. Optionally add or update minimal tests under `test/` or `src/__tests__/`.
4. Run TypeScript type-checking (if wired into tools) or at least ensure no type errors logically.
5. Once acceptance criteria are met, consider that phase “complete” and proceed to the next phase.

## 4. Cross-Workspace Interaction (Baklava + CLD-Engine)

When building adapters or integration code in the Baklava workspace:

- Treat CLD-Engine as a library with documented API from `src/index.ts`.
- Use `read_file` to inspect:
  - Baklava `Graph`, `Editor`, and CLDVariableNode implementations for mapping needs.
- Design an adapter that:
  - Reads Baklava graphs and produces CLD-Engine `Graph` instances.
  - Maps CLD-Engine execution results back into Baklava nodes/state.

## 5. Cursor Settings Suggestions (For the Human User)

To make CLD-Engine work smoother with Cursor:

- Ensure the `CLD-Engine/` folder is part of the active workspace.
- Prefer default codebase search behavior (Cursor chooses chunks) for:
  - `src/core/`, `src/nodes/`, and `docs/` under `CLD-Engine/`.
- Keep web search **off** for CLD-Engine work unless explicitly needed, to avoid noisy context.
